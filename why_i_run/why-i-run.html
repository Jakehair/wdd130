            <h2 id="fifty-twenty-title">The 50-20:</h2>
            <p>
              In my Senior year, the boy scout program put on an activity called
              the 50/20, where a participant would walk/run 50 miles in under 20
              hours. I don’t really know what drew me in, but for some reason, I
              had no self-doubt about whether I could do it or not. It almost
              felt like I was living two different lives, one where I felt
              completely invisible and incapable at school, and one where I knew
              I could do anything if I put my mind to it. So, I began the
              50-mile adventure with some of my family and friends. The first 25
              miles were kind of fun to be honest, (keep in mind I was just
              walking). Something happened though when all my friends and family
              decided to stop, and I kept going. I kept telling myself that I
              was going to finish no matter what. No matter how long it took. By
              about mile 35 my feet had some serious blisters that made walking
              very difficult, but I taped them up and kept going on my way. I
              had amazing leaders in the scouting program that stayed up through
              the night and brought me ibuprofen and food when I needed it. It
              was in those quiet moments of walking through the night that I
              learned that IMPOSSIBLE THINGS HAPPEN JUST ONE STEP AT A TIME. At
              about mile 45 I sat down to eat some food and when I found it
              almost impossible to start walking again, my legs had cramped up
              and were in so much pain. When I eventually limped across the
              finish line it took me about 17 hours! I learned a few things that
              day: 1. I CAN DO HARD THINGS 2. If I wanted to accomplish
              something big, all it took was a FEROCIOUS DETERMINATION and
              CONTINUED FOCUS. And 3. I was not in the best shape at the time,
              but I learned that I love to push myself physically beyond what I
              originally thought possible.

            <h2>My first half marathon:</h2>
            <p>
              After I had graduated high school, my older brother had been
              running for a while, and I had this weird and random item on my
              bucket list to one day run 100 miles. So, I decided to work
              towards that goal by first training for a half marathon. I
              couldn’t have imagined what would happen the next couple months as
              I began my training. I found a simple training plan online and
              followed it to the T. I was tired of being undisciplined and
              afraid, so I decided to stick to the plan no matter what. This was
              the time where I really learned to love running. I would wake up
              early before work and drive to the canyon which was close by and
              run on the paved trail with the beautiful views of the mountains,
              and the river running next to me. The process of training for this
              race changed me. It made me more disciplined in almost all other
              aspects of my life. I gained greater overall happiness in life
              from exercising almost every day. And I started believing in
              myself more and more. When the race came, I ended up running way
              too fast in the beginning and was in so much pain towards the end
              because I tried to run faster than I had trained for and ended up
              running it slower than I had hoped. But that’s a lesson for
              another day. After this race, I trained for a marathon which had
              much the same effect, and a 50 mile ultramarathon.

            <h2>Trail running and the Bryce Canyon 50-mile ultramarathon:</h2>
            <p id="para-3">
              Let me preface this with the fact that I was not as well prepared
              for this race as I had hoped and had to walk for a good chunk of
              it. I’m sharing this to describe my understanding on how progress
              in life works. In preparation for my eventual 100 mile race,
              earlier this year I decided to begin training for a 50 mile
              ultramarathon. An ultramarathon is just any race event that is a
              greater distance than a marathon, or 26.2 miles. My older brother
              also wanted to run 50 miles, and we started together. By about
              mile 25 his legs were cramping badly. This course climbs about
              7000 feet in elevation so it’s hard on the legs. For some reason,
              I don’t have problems with cramping muscles, so at about this time
              I left him and was on my own. This was difficult for me and took
              me back to when I was walking in the 50/20 alone. I had to keep
              talking to myself people who passed me probably thought I was
              crazy. Starting at about mile for at least a good 8 miles I simply
              walked because I was feeling sorry for myself and just kept
              focusing on the pain. This is when I learned the next lesson,
              DON’T FOCUS ON THE PAIN! Towards the end of the race I saw a man
              who looked like he needed some medical help. He was sitting when I
              saw him, but then he stood when he saw me and tried to keep
              walking. He was shaking badly. He said “I think I need some
              medical attention”, knowing that I didn’t know how to help him, I
              responded “I’ll go up ahead let someone know.” and just like that,
              I began running once again. I don’t know what was happening, it
              was like someone took all the pain away and I was able to just
              run. For about a mile and a half, and with some of the most brutal
              elevation gain on the course, I ran to tell someone who could
              help, that there was a man who needed help. When I finally got to
              the aid station to tell one of the workers, It’s like all that
              energy left me and I no longer was running as fast. I don’t know
              what happened to that man, but I was told they would go find and
              help him. After this I was still running, but couldn’t move very
              fast at all. I walked a lot, but finished soon after. It took 14
              gruesome hours. I honestly couldn’t believe what had happened.
              There were so many lessons to be learned, the chief one among them
              was WHEN WE FOCUS ON HELPING OTHERS, OUR PAIN IS RELIEVED. My
              brother was pretty upset that he didn’t finish, but he made it 45
              miles in agonizing pain as the muscles in his legs cramped up
              again and again. He is determined to beat me in his next race
              though. This truly was an experience I will never forget, and one
              that makes me excited for future races. Although once again I
              didn’t do as well as I had hoped because I got in my head and
              started focusing on myself, I learned some things that will help
              me improve in my next race.

            <h2 class="para-title">Why I run:</h2>
            <p>
              I could be wrong, but I believe that everyone of us wants to see
              what we’re truly capable of. And that can be a scary thing working
              towards something new because fear of discomfort and failure make
              it hard to want to try. But I’ve learned that the fear of the pain
              and discomfort are only required barriers to the joy and
              satisfaction that come when working towards something and
              eventually achieving it. I run because It makes me a better
              person. I run because frankly, my life is too comfortable. We live
              in a time of so much convenience that I believe we need to
              sometimes create inconvenience. Life is more fulfilling that way.
              I’m not suggesting that everyone should run, but I do believe that
              everyone needs something to ground them in their lives, something
              to go back to again and again and again. Something to work on and
              improve. and running is a fantastic option. It’s this process that
              excites me and makes me want to chase my dreams. No matter how
              impossible they are or how unqualified I am. I have learned so
              much from consistently running. I still struggle some days to have
              the desire to run, but on those days especially when I do it
              anyway are the days when I grow the most.

                Running has changed my life! I have always been a quiet guy who wants to chase his dreams, but too fearful of what others may think. In fact, in high school I really wanted to try out for sports but had no faith in my own ability to succeed. So, because of fear of failure, I never tried. When basketball or track tryouts came around, I would always ask myself, “I wonder If I could do it?” but then I wouldn’t ever find out. It became a habit to just put things off for the future where I would never change or improve. Now, I am trying my best to change that.

                Running has given me an opportunity to fight back against those negative voices that tell me I can't, or that I shouldn’t try. The voices that tell me I’m ok right where I am. The feelings and thoughts that try to convince me I will never be any better than I am right now. My message to everyone is that with consistent effort and firm minds, we can overcome these and other common challenges that try to halt our progress, and ultimately rob our lives of joy, satisfaction, and fulfilment.
